# Codewars Katas on Ruby

## Sum of Intervals

Write a function called sumIntervals/sum_intervals() that accepts an array of intervals, and returns the sum of all the interval lengths. Overlapping intervals should only be counted once.

Intervals
Intervals are represented by a pair of integers in the form of an array. The first value of the interval will always be less than the second value. Interval example: [1, 5] is an interval from 1 to 5. The length of this interval is 4.

Overlapping Intervals
List containing overlapping intervals:

```ruby
[
  [1,4],
  [7, 10],
  [3, 5]
]
```
The sum of the lengths of these intervals is 7. Since [1, 4] and [3, 5] overlap, we can treat the interval as [1, 5], which has a length of 4.

Examples:

```ruby
sumIntervals( [
   [1,2],
   [6, 10],
   [11, 15]
] ); // => 9

sumIntervals( [
   [1,4],
   [7, 10],
   [3, 5]
] ); // => 7

sumIntervals( [
   [1,5],
   [10, 20],
   [1, 6],
   [16, 19],
   [5, 11]
] ); // => 19
```

## Valid Braces

Write a function that takes a string of braces, and determines if the order of the braces is valid. It should return true if the string is valid, and false if it's invalid.

This Kata is similar to the Valid Parentheses Kata, but introduces new characters: brackets [], and curly braces {}. Thanks to @arnedag for the idea!

All input strings will be nonempty, and will only consist of parentheses, brackets and curly braces: ()[]{}.

What is considered Valid?
A string of braces is considered valid if all braces are matched with the correct brace.

Examples

```ruby
"(){}[]"   =>  True
"([{}])"   =>  True
"(}"       =>  False
"[(])"     =>  False
"[({})](]" =>  False
```

## Strip Comments

Complete the solution so that it strips all text that follows any of a set of comment markers passed in. Any whitespace at the end of the line should also be stripped out.

Example:

Given an input string of:

```ruby
apples, pears # and bananas
grapes
bananas !apples
```

The output expected would be:

```ruby
apples, pears
grapes
bananas
```
The code would be called like so:

```ruby
result = solution("apples, pears # and bananas\ngrapes\nbananas !apples", ["#", "!"])
# result should == "apples, pears\ngrapes\nbananas"
```

## Calculating with Functions

This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the results. Let's have a look at some examples:

```ruby
seven(times(five())) # must return 35
four(plus(nine())) # must return 13
eight(minus(three())) # must return 5
six(divided_by(two())) # must return 3
```

Requirements:

* There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")
* There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, dividedBy (divided_by in Ruby and Python)
* Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers
* The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand
* Division should be integer division. For example, this should return 2, not 2.666666...:

## Convert A Hex String To RGB

When working with color values it can sometimes be useful to extract the individual red, green, and blue (RGB) component values for a color. Implement a function that meets these requirements:

* Accepts a case-insensitive hexadecimal color string as its parameter (ex. "#FF9933" or "#ff9933")
* Returns a Map<String, int> with the structure {r: 255, g: 153, b: 51} where r, g, and b range from 0 through 255

Note: your implementation does not need to support the shorthand form of hexadecimal notation (ie "#FFF")

Example

```ruby
"#FF9933" --> {r: 255, g: 153, b: 51}
```

## Permutations

In this kata you have to create all permutations of an input string and remove duplicates, if present. This means, you have to shuffle all letters from the input in all possible orders.

Examples:

```ruby
permutations('a'); # ['a']
permutations('ab'); # ['ab', 'ba']
permutations('aabb'); # ['aabb', 'abab', 'abba', 'baab', 'baba', 'bbaa']
```

## ISBN-10 Validation

ISBN-10 identifiers are ten digits long. The first nine characters are digits 0-9. The last digit can be 0-9 or X, to indicate a value of 10.

An ISBN-10 number is valid if the sum of the digits multiplied by their position modulo 11 equals zero.

For example:

```ruby
ISBN     : 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3  9
position : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

This is a valid ISBN, because:

```ruby
(1*1 + 1*2 + 1*3 + 2*4 + 2*5 + 2*6 + 3*7 + 3*8 + 3*9 + 9*10) % 11 = 0
```

Examples

```ruby
1112223339   -->  true
111222333    -->  false
1112223339X  -->  false
1234554321   -->  true
1234512345   -->  false
048665088X   -->  true
X123456788   -->  false
```
